IMPORTANT! to view the project, you need to download the file (group_assignment3.html) first. For some reason github is unable to open the html file.

This report was a group project for my Topics in statistics: data analysis university course, where we were given a data set without any explanation on what it contained or how it
should be interpreted. The only rule for the assignments for the course was that we had to return a 10 page report. Everything else was left under our discretion.

For this specific report, we discovered that the data-set given to us consisted of various data from a fictional airport, related to plane departure times, delays and security queuing waiting times.

My contributions included creating the data dictionary, creating the narrrative & story creating the interactive html document & visualizations (fig 1.0-2.1).
